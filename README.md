# Hangman

This project was about creating the game hangman using python. I learnt how to create and utilise a class to make this game in a simple and reusable format.

To install this game, just download milestone5.py and run it on python3 using the command in the bash terminal at the location of the file: python3 milestone5.py

when you run this command, the game will begin. You have 5 lives, you must guess the letters of the word within 5 lives and correctly identify the word or you lose. Each time you get an incorrect answer, you will lose a life.
